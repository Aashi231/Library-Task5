Added Task 5 SQL joins queries and README.

Project Title: Library Management System - SQL Joins

Task Objective:
This task demonstrates combining data from multiple related tables in the Library Management System using various types of SQL joins.

What I Did:
a)Used INNER JOIN to display loans along with corresponding book titles.
b)Used LEFT JOIN to list all books with their loan information, including books never loaned.
c)Simulated RIGHT JOIN by swapping tables in LEFT JOIN, since SQLite does not support RIGHT JOIN directly.
d)Simulated FULL OUTER JOIN by combining LEFT JOINs with UNION to show all records from both tables.
e)Tested the joins in SQLiteStudio to verify correct relationships and results.

Key SQL Fetaures Used:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN(simulated)
- FULL OUTER JOIN (simulated with UNION)

  Tools Used:
  - SQLiteStudio
 
  Outcome:
  The database queries now demonstrate the ability to merge and combine data across tables using various join operations, which is essential for relational data analysis.
